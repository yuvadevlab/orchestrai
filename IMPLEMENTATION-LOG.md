## [2026-09-18] — Phase 0: Workspace & Engineering Foundation (Initial Monorepo Setup)

### Summary of Changes

- Established root pnpm workspace with Turborepo task pipeline (`package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`).
- Added Commitlint (`commitlint.config.ts`), Husky hooks (`commit-msg`, `pre-commit`), and `lint-staged`.
- Configured ESLint (`eslint.config.js`) and Prettier (`.prettierrc`) with `eslint-plugin-prettier` and `typescript-eslint`.
- Codified strict file standards in `.agents/rules/00-core-invariants.md`:
  - 250-line hard maximum per file (proactive decomposition at 200 lines).
  - Code splitting into smaller, single-responsibility files.
  - Detailed JSDoc on all exported functions, classes, interfaces, and schemas.
  - Explanatory inline comments on all conditionals, guards, and edge cases.
- Configured strict TypeScript defaults with project reference capability (`tsconfig.base.json`, `tsconfig.json`).
- Scaffolding complete directory structure:
  - `apps/`: `gateway`, `worker`, `realtime`, `console`
  - `packages/`: `core`, `models`, `tools`, `agent`, `runtime`, `queue`, `events`, `memory`, `rag`, `observability`, `sdk`
  - `infrastructure/`: `docker`, `postgres`, `redis`, `ollama`, `nginx`, `monitoring`
  - `scripts/`: automation utilities
  - `docs/`: architecture, ADRs, learning notes, interview prep, phase guides
- Created multi-agent AI operating standard:
  - Universal `.agents/AGENTS.md`
  - Rules: `architecture.md`, `coding-standards.md`, `session-continuity.md`
  - Skills: `orchestrai-context`
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Created core documentation:
  - `PROGRESS.md` live tracking table
  - `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `docs/adr/ADR-001-monorepo-first.md`
  - Phase 0 and Phase 1 detailed guides.

### Architectural Rationale

- Adopted strict boundaries: `@orchestrai/core` serves as the invariant contract foundation with zero internal dependencies.
- Local-first architecture: Docker compose defines PostgreSQL, Redis, and Ollama to guarantee zero cloud dependencies during active development.
- Single source of truth for session continuity: `PROGRESS.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION-LOG.md` ensure that any AI agent in any session can immediately orient and continue without re-doing or breaking existing work.

### Known Limitations / Stubs

- Package directories currently contain directory markers (`.gitkeep`) and README documentation. Next step is wiring their initial package.json descriptors and running pnpm install.

### Exact Next Steps for Next Session / Continuation

1. Create `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` for `@orchestrai/core` (Phase 1).
2. Wire up root devDependencies and verify `pnpm install` succeeds.
3. Verify `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build` pass via Turborepo.
4. Mark Phase 0 as complete `[x]` and begin Phase 1 contracts implementation.
